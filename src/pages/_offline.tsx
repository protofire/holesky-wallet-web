              While you wait for your internet to come back online, we encourage you to take a moment to step outside
              and enjoy the nature. If you have the opportunity, try touching the grass with your bare feet -
              there&apos;s something about the sensation of grass on our skin that can be really grounding and
              refreshing.
            </Typography>

            <Typography variant="body1" mt={2}>
              We hope to see you back online soon. Thank you for your patience.
