    <h3>3. What are the Services offered?</h3>
    <p>
      Our services (&ldquo;Services&rdquo;) primarily consist of enabling users to create their Safe Accounts and
      ongoing interaction with it on the Blockchain.
    </p>
    <ol start={1}>
      <li>&ldquo;Safe Account&rdquo; </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      A Safe Account is a modular, self-custodial (i.e. not supervised by us) smart contract-based wallet not provided
      by CC. Safe Accounts are{' '}
      <Link href="https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/" passHref legacyBehavior>
        <MUILink target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
          open-source
        </MUILink>
      </Link>
      &nbsp;released under LGPL-3.0.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smart contract wallet means, unlike a standard private key Wallet, that access control for authorizing any
      Transaction is defined in code. An example are multi-signature wallets which require that any Transaction must be
      signed by a minimum number of signing wallets whereby the specifics of the requirements to authorize a Transaction
      can be configured in code.{' '}
    </p>
    <p>
      Owners need to connect a signing wallet with a Safe Account. Safe Accounts are compatible inter alia with standard
      private key Wallets such as hardware wallets, browser extension wallets and mobile wallets that support
      WalletConnect.
    </p>
    <ol start={2}>
      <li>&ldquo;Safe App&rdquo;</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      You may access Safe Accounts using the {'Holesky Safe'} web app, mobile app for iOS and android, or the browser
      extension&nbsp;(each a &ldquo;Safe App&rdquo;). The Safe App may be used to manage your personal digital assets on
      Ethereum and other common EVM chains when you connect a Safe Account with third-party&nbsp;services (as defined
      below). The Safe App provides certain features that may be amended from time to time.{' '}
    </p>
    <ol start={3}>
      <li>&ldquo;Third-Party&nbsp;Safe Apps&rdquo;</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The Safe App allows you to connect Safe Accounts to third-party decentralized applications
      (&ldquo;Third-Party&nbsp;Safe Apps&rdquo;) and use third-party&nbsp;services such as from the decentralized
      finance sector, DAO Tools or services related to NFTs (&ldquo;Third-Party&nbsp;Services&quot;). The
      Third-Party&nbsp;Safe Apps are integrated in the user interface of the Safe App via inline framing. The provider
      of the Third-Party&nbsp;Safe App and related Third-Party Service is responsible for the operation of the service
      and the correctness, completeness and actuality of any information provided therein. We make a pre-selection of
      Third-Party&nbsp;Safe Apps that we show in the Safe App. However, we only perform a rough triage in advance for
      obvious problems and functionality in terms of loading time and resolution capability of the transactions.
      Accordingly, in the event of any (technical) issues concerning the Third-Party Services, the user must only
      contact the respective service provider directly. The terms of service, if any, shall be governed by the
      applicable contractual provisions between the User and the respective provider of the Third-Party&nbsp;Service.
      Accordingly, we are not liable in the event of a breach of contract, damage or loss related to the use of such
      Third-Party Service.
    </p>

    <ol start={1}>

        We provide you the possibility to interact with your Safe Account through&nbsp;Third-Party Services. Any
        activities you engage in with, or services you receive from a third party is between you and that third party
        directly. The conditions of service provisions, if any, shall be governed by the applicable contractual
        provisions between you and the respective provider of the Third-Party Service.{' '}
      </li>
      <li>
        The Services rely in part on third-party and open-source software, including the Blockchain, and the continued
        development and support by third parties. There is no assurance or guarantee that those third parties will
        maintain their support of their software or that open-source software will continue to be maintained. This may
        have a material adverse effect on the Services.
      </li>
      <li>This means specifically:</li>
    </ol>

        Third-Party Service.
      </li>
      <li>
        We have not conducted any security audit, bug bounty or formal verification (whether internal or external) of
        the Third-Party Services.

      <li>
        We have no control over, do not recommend, endorse, or otherwise take a position on the integrity, functioning
        of, content and your use of Third-Party&nbsp;Services, whose sole responsibility lies with the person from whom
        such services or content originated.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you access or use Third-Party&nbsp;Services you accept that there are risks in doing so and that you alone
        assume any such risks when choosing to interact with them. We are not liable for any errors or omissions or for
        any damages or loss you might suffer through interacting with those Third-Party&nbsp;Services, such as
        Third-Party&nbsp;Safe Apps.
      </li>
      <li>
        You know of the inherent risks of cryptographic and Blockchain-based systems and the high volatility of Token
        markets. Transactions undertaken in the Blockchain are irrevocable and irreversible and there is no possibility
        to refund Token that have been deployed.
      </li>
      <li>
        You should read the license requirements, terms and conditions as well as privacy policy of each

        Transactions that entail a high degree of risk.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you contribute integrations to Third-Party&nbsp;Services, you are responsible for all content you contribute,
        in any manner, and you must have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it. You
        are responsible for all your activity in connection with any such Third-Party&nbsp;Service.{' '}

        of goods and services, financial transactions, and any other terms associated with such dealings, are solely
        between you and such persons. You agree that we shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any
        sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.
      </li>
      <li>
        If there is a dispute between you and the Third-Party&nbsp;Service provider or/and other users of the
        Third-Party&nbsp;Service, you agree that we are under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you
        have a dispute with one or more other users, you release us, our officers, employees, agents, contractors and
        successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or
        unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our
        Services.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. What are the fees for the Services?</h3>
    <ol start={1}>

        If the Safe App or Services are provided to the User free of charge (please note, in this context, that any
        service, network, and/or transaction fees may be charged by third parties via the Blockchain and not necessarily
        by us), CC shall be liable only in cases of intent, gross negligence, or if CC has fraudulently concealed a
        possible material or legal defect of the Safe App or Services. If the Safe App or Services are not provided to
        the User free of charge, CC shall be liable only (i) in cases pursuant to Clause 17.1 as well as (ii) in cases
        of simple negligence for damages resulting from the breach of an essential contractual duty, a duty, the
        performance of which enables the proper execution of this Agreement in the first place and on the compliance of
        which the User regularly relies and may rely, whereby CC&apos;s liability shall be limited to the compensation
        of the foreseeable, typically occurring damage. The Parties agree that the typical foreseeable damage equals the
        sum of the annual Fees paid or agreed to be paid by the User to CC during the course of the calendar year in

        health, (ii) insofar as CC has assumed a guarantee, (iii) to claims of the User according to the Product
        Liability Act and (iv) to claims of the User according to the applicable data protection law. The limitation of
        liability also applies to the personal liability of the organs, legal representatives, employees and vicarious
        agents of CC. If the User suffers damages due to the loss of data, CC is not liable for this, insofar as the
        damage would have been avoided by a regular and complete backup of all relevant data by the User. In the event
        of disruptions to the technical infrastructure, the internet connection or a relevant Blockchain that we are not
        responsible for, we shall be exempt from our obligation to perform. This also applies if we are prevented from
        performing due to force majeure or other circumstances, the elimination of which is not possible or cannot be
