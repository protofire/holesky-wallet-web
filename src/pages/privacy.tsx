    <h3 id="section-3">3. Your information and the Blockchain</h3>
    <p>
      Blockchains, also known as distributed ledger technology (or simply &lsquo;DLT&rsquo;), are made up of digitally
      recorded data in a chain of packages called &lsquo;blocks&rsquo;. The manner in which these blocks are linked is
      chronological, meaning that the data is very difficult to alter once recorded. Since the ledger may be distributed
      all over the world (across several &lsquo;nodes&rsquo; which usually replicate the ledger) this means there is no
      single person making decisions or otherwise administering the system (such as an operator of a cloud computing
      system), and that there is no centralized place where it is located either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, by design, records of a Blockchain cannot be changed or deleted and are said to be
      &lsquo;immutable&rsquo;. This may affect your ability to exercise your rights such as your right to erasure
      (&lsquo;right to be forgotten&rsquo;), or your rights to object or restrict processing of your personal data. Data
      on the Blockchain cannot be erased and cannot be changed. Although smart contracts may be used to revoke certain
      access rights, and some content may be made invisible to others, it is not deleted.
    </p>
    <p>
      In certain circumstances, in order to comply with our contractual obligations to you (such as delivery of Tokens)
      it will be necessary to write certain personal data, such as your Wallet address, onto the Blockchain; this is
      done through a smart contract and requires you to execute such transactions using your Wallet&rsquo;s Private Key.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most cases ultimate decisions to (i) transact on the Blockchain using your Wallet, as well as (ii) share the
      Public Key relating to your Wallet with anyone (including us) rests with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      IF YOU WANT TO ENSURE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS ARE NOT AFFECTED IN ANY WAY, YOU SHOULD NOT TRANSACT ON BLOCKCHAINS AS
      CERTAIN RIGHTS MAY NOT BE FULLY AVAILABLE OR EXERCISABLE BY YOU OR US DUE TO THE TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF
      THE BLOCKCHAIN. IN PARTICULAR THE BLOCKCHAIN IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND ANY PERSONAL DATA SHARED ON THE
      BLOCKCHAIN WILL BECOME PUBLICLY AVAILABLE

    </ul>
    <p>
      HOWEVER, WHEN INTERACTING WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS DELETED.
      THIS IS BECAUSE THE BLOCKCHAIN IS A PUBLIC DECENTRALIZED NETWORK AND BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY DOES NOT GENERALLY
      ALLOW FOR DATA TO BE DELETED AND YOUR RIGHT TO ERASURE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE FULLY ENFORCED. IN THESE
      CIRCUMSTANCES WE WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT ALL PERSONAL DATA THAT IS HELD BY US IS PERMANENTLY DELETED.

    <ol>
      <li>you contest the accuracy of the personal information;</li>
      <li>
        where processing is unlawful you may request, instead of requesting erasure, that we restrict the use of the
        unlawfully processed personal information;
      </li>
      <li>
        we no longer need to process your personal information but need to retain your information for the
        establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      You also have the right to object to processing of your personal information under certain circumstances, such as
      where the processing is based on your consent and you withdraw that consent. This may impact the services we can
      provide and we will explain this to you if you decide to exercise this right.
    </p>
    <p>
      HOWEVER, WHEN INTERACTING WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN, AS IT IS A PUBLIC DECENTRALIZED NETWORK, WE WILL LIKELY NOT BE ABLE
      TO PREVENT EXTERNAL PARTIES FROM PROCESSING ANY PERSONAL DATA WHICH HAS BEEN WRITTEN ONTO THE BLOCKCHAIN. IN THESE
      CIRCUMSTANCES WE WILL USE OUR REASONABLE ENDEAVORS TO ENSURE THAT ALL PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA HELD BY US IS

      machine-readable format, or ask us to send it to another person.
    </p>
    <h5>Right to freedom from automated decision-making</h5>
    <p>
      As explained above, we do not use automated decision-making, but where any automated decision-making takes place,
      you have the right in this case to express your point of view and to contest the decision, as well as request that
      decisions based on automated processing concerning you or significantly affecting you and based on your personal
      data are made by natural persons, not only by computers.

      business partners, and such communications generally do not offer an option to unsubscribe as they are necessary
      to provide the services requested. Therefore, please be aware that your ability to opt-out from receiving
