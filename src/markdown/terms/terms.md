# 1\. What is the scope of the Terms? {#1.-what-is-the-scope-of-the-terms?}

These Terms and Conditions (“**Terms**”) become part of any contract (“**Agreement**”) between you (“**you**”, “**yours**” or “**User**”) and Core Contributors GmbH (“**CC**”, “**we**”, “**our**” or “**us**”) provided we made these Terms accessible to you prior to entering into the Agreement and you consent to these Terms. We are a limited liability company registered with the commercial register of Berlin Charlottenburg under company number HRB 240421 B, with its registered office at Gontardstraße 11, 10178 Berlin, Germany. You can contact us by writing to info@cc0x.dev.

The Agreement is concluded by using the Mobile App, Web App and/or Browser Extension subject to these Terms. The use of our Services is only permitted to legal entities, partnerships and natural persons with unlimited legal capacity. In particular, minors are prohibited from using our Services.

The application of your general terms and conditions is excluded. Your deviating, conflicting or supplementary general terms and conditions shall only become part of the Agreement if and to the extent that CC has expressly agreed to their application in writing. This consent requirement shall apply in any case, even if for example CC, being aware of your general terms and conditions, accepts payments by the contractual partner without reservations.

We reserve the right to change these Terms at any time and without giving reasons, while considering and weighing your interests. The new Terms will be communicated to you in advance. If you do not accept the new Terms, you are no longer entitled to use the Services.

# 2\. What do some of the capitalized terms mean in the Agreement? {#2.-what-do-some-of-the-capitalized-terms-mean-in-the-agreement?}

“**Blockchain**” means a mathematically secured consensus ledger such as the Ethereum Virtual Machine, an Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible validation mechanism, or other decentralized validation mechanisms.

“**Transaction**” means a change to the data set through a new entry in the continuous Blockchain.

“**Smart Contract**” means a piece of source code deployed as an application on the Blockchain which can be executed, including self-execution of Transactions as well as execution triggered by 3rd parties.

“**Token**” means a digital asset transferred in a Transaction, including ETH, ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens.

“**Wallet**” means a cryptographic storage solution permitting you to store cryptographic assets by correlation of a (i) Public Key and (ii) a Private Key, or a Smart Contract to receive, manage and send Tokens.

“**Recovery Phrase**” means a series of secret words used to generate one or more Private Keys and derived Public Keys.

“**Public Key**” means a unique sequence of numbers and letters within the Blockchain to distinguish the network participants from each other.

“**Private Key**” means a unique sequence of numbers and/or letters required to initiate a Blockchain Transaction and should only be known by the legal owner of the Wallet.

# 3\. What are the Services offered? {#3.-what-are-the-services-offered?}

Our services (“**Services**”) primarily consist of enabling users to create their Safe Accounts and ongoing interaction with it on the Blockchain.

1. “**Safe Account**”

A Safe Account is a modular, self-custodial (i.e. not supervised by us) smart contract-based wallet not provided by CC. Safe Accounts are open-source released under LGPL-3.0.

Smart contract wallet means, unlike a standard private key Wallet, that access control for authorizing any Transaction is defined in code. An example are multi-signature wallets which require that any Transaction must be signed by a minimum number of signing wallets whereby the specifics of the requirements to authorize a Transaction can be configured in code.

Owners need to connect a signing wallet with a Safe Account. Safe Accounts are compatible inter alia with standard private key Wallets such as hardware wallets, browser extension wallets and mobile wallets that support WalletConnect.

2. “**Safe{Wallet} App**”

You may access Safe Accounts using the Safe{Wallet} web app, mobile app for iOS and android, or the browser extension (each a “Safe{Wallet} App”). The Safe{Wallet} App may be used to manage your personal digital assets on Ethereum and other common EVM chains when you connect a Safe Account with third-party services (as defined below). The Safe{Wallet} App provides certain features that may be amended from time to time.

3. “**Third-Party Safe Apps**”

The Safe{Wallet} App allows you to connect Safe Accounts to third-party applications (“Third-Party Safe Apps”) and use third-party services such as from the decentralized finance sector, DAO tools or services related to NFTs (“Third-Party Services"). The Third-Party Safe Apps are integrated in the user interface of the Safe{Wallet} App via inline framing. The provider of the Third-Party Safe App and/or related Third-Party Services is responsible for the operation of the service and the correctness, completeness and actuality of any information provided therein. We make a pre-selection of Third-Party Safe Apps that we show in the Safe{Wallet} App. However, we only perform a rough triage in advance for obvious problems and functionality in terms of loading time and resolution capability of the transactions. Accordingly, in the event of any (technical) issues concerning the Third-Party Services, the user must only contact the respective service provider directly. The terms of service, if any, shall be governed by the applicable contractual provisions between the User and the respective provider of the Third-Party Safe Apps or Third-Party Services. Accordingly, we are not liable in the event of a breach of contract, damage or loss related to the use of such Third-Party Safe Apps or Third-Party Services.

# 4\. What do the Services not consist of? {#4.-what-do-the-services-not-consist-of?}

2. The Services rely in part on third-party and open-source software, including the Blockchain, and the continued development and support by third parties.

This may have a material adverse effect on the Services.
